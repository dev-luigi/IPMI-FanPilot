# Changelog

All notable changes to IPMIDeck are recorded here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

At release time the release workflow slices the `## [<version>]` section out of this file and uses
it as the GitHub Release body. Before tagging a version, promote the relevant `[Unreleased]` items
into a new dated `## [<version>] - YYYY-MM-DD` section.

## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.1] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed

- Session expiry is now honored. `IPMIDECK_AUTH_SESSION_EXPIRY` (and the `auth.session_expiry`
  config key) now set the session token and cookie lifetime; previously the setting had no effect
  and the lifetime was always 24 hours.
- FanPilot status no longer reports "active" for monitoring-only vendors (HPE, Lenovo, and unknown
  BMCs). Their fans stay under the BMC's own control, and the dashboard now shows that instead of a
  false "FanPilot active" state.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-13

Complete rewrite. v1 was a single-page app that pushed fan commands at one Dell PowerEdge; v2 is a
self-hosted IPMI platform — a Python/FastAPI backend serving a React dashboard, talking to any
number of BMCs over ipmitool. Everything runs locally: SQLite on disk, no cloud, no telemetry.

### Added

- Multi-server dashboard with live sensors (temperature, fan RPM, voltage, power) over a WebSocket,
  history charts, and a drag-and-drop widget grid.
- FanPilot: a backend fan-curve engine with hysteresis, a non-negotiable safety override at the
  critical threshold, and fail-safe handling when a BMC becomes unreachable.
- Power control (on, soft off, hard off, reset, cycle) with an audit log and per-server energy-cost
  tracking.
- Hardware event log (SEL) and FRU inventory, both browsable, searchable, and exportable to CSV/JSON.
- 12 languages, dark and light themes, optional local authentication, HTTPS with self-signed
  certificates, and one-click backup/restore.
- Ships as a multi-arch Docker image (`devluigi06/ipmideck`) and the `ipmideck` package on PyPI.

### Notes

- Fan control is vendor-specific: Dell is tested on real hardware; Supermicro and IBM are
  experimental; HPE, Lenovo, and unknown BMCs are monitoring-only (full sensors, power, SEL, and
  FRU, but no fan writes).
